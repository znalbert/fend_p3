##Instructions

Just go [here](http://znalbert.github.io/fend_p3/) and the game will load.  It's always in a play state.  Once you run out of lives it just resets your score, lives, and the bug speed.

To control the player use the arrow keys on your keyboard and try to get to the water without running into any bugs!
